# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 03, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on psd to html/css website.

**Thoughts:** Using Tachyons to build the psd to html/css website for practice. 

### Day 2: Jan 04, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to work just on forms to before finishing the website to become better at it without holding up progress.

**Thoughts:** I am using Tachyons to build the forms and some having some issues with how to add margin 

### Day 3: Jan 05, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: continued my work on forms.

**Thoughts:** I have to add to my style.css to adjust widths of input boxes. I have the display inline and block figured out for correct displays with input and labels.
